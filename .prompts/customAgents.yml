    {{!-- Note: The context section below will resolve all context elements
    (e.g. files) to their full content

    in the system prompt. Context elements can be added by the user in the
    default chat view (e.g. via DnD or the "+" button).

    If you want a more fine-grained, on demand resolvement of context elements,
    you can also resolve files to their paths only

    and equip the agent with functions so that the LLM can retrieve files on
    demand. See the Coder Agent prompt for an example.--}}
